            <p id="explore">The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures.
